# Cyber Security Simulator - Advanced Java Application

This Java-based GUI application exemplifies the integration of essential cybersecurity functionalities while leveraging advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application includes three primary modules:

1. **🔒 Password Strength Checker**
2. **🔐 Encryption/Decryption Utility (Caesar Cipher)**
3. **🔑 Password Generator**

Each module reflects modular design and ensures adaptability, maintainability, and user-centric functionality.

## Application Modules and Their Functionalities

### 1. **🔒 Password Strength Checker**

- **Objective**: Assesses the strength of a user-input password, classifying it as Weak, Moderate, or Strong based on predefined criteria.
- **Key OOP Principles Utilized**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Password validation logic resides in a private `checkStrength` method, abstracting the implementation details.
  - **Event-Driven Programming**: Action events are handled via `ActionListener`, ensuring user interaction drives the functionality.

### 2. **🔐 Encryption/Decryption Utility**

- **Objective**: Provides text encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a fixed shift value of 3.
- **Key OOP Principles Utilized**:
  - **Encapsulation**: The cipher logic is encapsulated within the `caesarCipher` method, promoting modularity.
  - **Polymorphism**: The same `caesarCipher` method accommodates both encryption and decryption by parameterizing the shift value.
  - **Event-Driven Programming**: Implements dynamic responses to user inputs via `ActionListener` mechanisms.

### 3. **🔑 Password Generator**

- **Objective**: Generates random, secure passwords of a specified length and displays them within the GUI.
- **Key OOP Principles Utilized**:
  - **Encapsulation**: The password generation logic is encapsulated within a private `generatePassword` method.
  - **Reusability**: The `showGUI` method ensures the GUI framework can be deployed independently across various modules.
  - **Event-Driven Programming**: Dynamically updates the generated password based on user actions.

## Core Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### 1. **🔒 Encapsulation**

- Core methods, including `generatePassword` and `caesarCipher`, are private, safeguarding internal implementation and enhancing modularity.
- GUI components (e.g., `JTextField`, `JButton`) are confined within respective modules to ensure cohesive design.

### 2. **📦 Abstraction**

- Complex functionalities are abstracted into high-level modules, such as `PasswordStrengthChecker`, `CipherSimulator`, and `PasswordGenerator`, fostering code clarity and scalability.

### 3. **🔀 Polymorphism**

- The `caesarCipher` method demonstrates polymorphism by accommodating both encryption and decryption functionalities through parameterized operations.

### 4. **🔄 Event-Driven Programming**

- Each module incorporates `ActionListener` to facilitate dynamic responses to user interactions, creating a seamless user experience.

### 5. **🔁 Reusability**

- GUI construction is modularized through reusable `showGUI` methods, enabling consistent implementation across various components.
